# NEXT TASK

Execute:
`Classify the 10 remaining reverse-pricing review projects`

## Current Input

The independent reverse-pricing workflow is deployed on commit `b72ff0c`.
It remains disconnected from cron.

The repair command is:

```bash
tender-radar pricing reprocess-existing --db data/tender_radar.sqlite \
  --report work/reports/pricing_reprocess_existing_YYYYMMDD.json
```

Optional guarded AI fallback exists, but it is only row extraction support:

```bash
tender-radar pricing reprocess-existing --db data/tender_radar.sqlite \
  --use-ai-fallback --ai-fallback-mode empty
```

AI output must still pass local row arithmetic and official document subtotal
validation before rows can complete a project.

Optional AI budget routing is also available:

```bash
tender-radar pricing reprocess-existing --db data/tender_radar.sqlite \
  --use-ai-budget-router
```

The router selects the likely budget document/page range and stores audit
metadata. It does not write rows. If routed parsing fails validation, the
command falls back to full deterministic reprocess.

## Latest Live Audit

After deploy and live reprocess reports
`work/reports/pricing_reprocess_v0143_quantity_total_guard.json` and
`work/reports/pricing_reprocess_220675_ai_router_guarded.json`:

- `OK`: `9`
  - `221148`
  - `221233`
  - `221369`
  - `221580`
  - `221615`
  - `221639`
  - `221689`
  - `221691`
  - `221695`
- `NEEDS_REVIEW`: `10`
  - `219795`
  - `220133`
  - `220220`
  - `220423`
  - `220675`
  - `221006`
  - `221368`
  - `221381`
  - `221452`
  - `221720`

Important validation fixes already deployed:

- category-prefixed budget rows;
- split `m2`/`m3` units;
- Greek dot thousands;
- wrapped numeric-prefix rows from archived documents;
- sparse OCR rows;
- OCR-corrupted `ΣΥΝΟΛΟ`;
- collapsed OCR stream rows;
- official subtotal candidate ranking;
- project-total selection before trailing `Π2: 0,00`;
- rejection of quantity-only totals such as `170,51τμ`.

## Instruction

Before building new reverse-pricing features, classify the remaining 10 review
projects into evidence-backed buckets.

For each project, report one of:

- `OK`
- `NEEDS_PARSER_FIX`
- `SOURCE_NOT_PRICING`
- `NO_PUBLIC_ATTACHMENTS`
- `MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED`

Do not mark a project `OK` unless:

1. merged row arithmetic passes, and
2. merged row sum reconciles with an official monetary subtotal from the
   extracted source documents.

## Suggested Next Gate

1. Inspect `220675` first. It now has parsed rows but no trusted reference
   total after quantity-total rejection. AI budget routing selected document
   id `232`, but the routed parse failed validation and correctly fell back to
   full reprocess. Determine whether the monetary subtotal exists in another
   extracted document or the source is not parseable enough.
2. Inspect `221720` next. It has many parsed rows but appears to be reading a
   price-list/table with many `quantity = 1` rows rather than the actual
   project budget. Add a generic guard if this pattern is confirmed.
3. Then inspect the zero/near-zero row cases: `220133`, `221006`, `221381`,
   `221452`.
4. Only after classification, add targeted parser or AI fallback improvements
   for one confirmed generic layout at a time.

## Required Tests

- Focused `tests/test_pricing.py` after every parser/audit rule change.
- Regression tests for each new generic parser layout fixed.
- Live read-only SQLite audit before and after any live reprocess.

## Required Closeout

1. Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with fixed/classified project ids and evidence.
2. Update `docs/DECISIONS.md` only for a real product/architecture decision.
3. Update `docs/HANDOFF.md` if production/deployment state changes.
4. Update this file with the next single executable gate.

## Future Backlog

- Pricing UI autocomplete for article codes/descriptions.
- Filters by article/revision code, operator, quantity, unit price and amount.
- Optional AI extraction only for ambiguous budget/table rows.
- Pricing cron only after manual nationwide pricing runs are stable and
  bounded.
